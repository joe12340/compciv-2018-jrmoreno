With this project I would like to identify the most commonly held assets by all senators . to do this I think the best method would be to iterate through each senators assets section and add unique occurrences to a list with a separate list that is the same size bit containing all zeros. If a name if repeated then add one to the corresponding index on the list. An issue I see is that  is if the same asset if referred to in a slightly different way then multiple occurrences will not be counted. For this reason it might be best to limit the search to stocks owned by senators as those names seem to be standardized.
In terms of visualization I would like to experiment  with of having this  information represented in augmented reality  on an ios mobile device.Once the data is prepared it is only matter transferring it into c#  so that it can be used by the Unity Game engine.
I think augmented reality could provide a unique mode of interaction if say the physical size of the stock corresponded to the number of senators that own it. Prospectively it would be even more engaging if the list of stocks returned the names of the senators who own it when clicked on.
